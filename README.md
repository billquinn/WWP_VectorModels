# WWP_VectorModels
The work here helped create word vector models of the Women Writers Vector Toolkit. In particular, the parser and bulk_transformer allowed us to partition the corpus into various models for comparative analysis. For more information, please see the [Women Writers Vector Toolkit](https://wwp.northeastern.edu/lab/wwvt/index.html), and the [Methodology](https://wwp.northeastern.edu/lab/wwvt/methodology/index.html) page in particular.
